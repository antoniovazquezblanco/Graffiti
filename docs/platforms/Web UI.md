## The basics

- Graffiti shows graph of methods/fields/lines you choose to add.
- When you add a node from the IDE, it will be linked to the currently selected element.
- The new node will be automatically selected, unless the setting changed
- Clicking a node will select it
- Right clicking a node will open it in the editor (as long it is connected)
- You can use `Ctrl+Z` and `Ctrl+Shift+Z` to undo/redo your actions
- Use `Ctrl+S` to save your graph to file. You can import it by dragging it to the screen.
- Use Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette for shortcuts and new actions

## Advance features

- You can add text nodes (`Ctrl+Shift+Q`) or comment nodes (`Ctrl+Q`)
- Click the share button to export the graph to image or svg
- To rename or remove a graph, right click the tab's name.
- A list of the linked projects is also available under the tab
- When node is selected, use 1-9 to theme it.
- Use `Home` to center the currently selected node
- Use `Escape` to unselect the current node.
- Use `Ctrl+f` or `Ctrl+Shift+f` to search a node
- Middle clicking a node will swap a node with the selected node (same parent). ctrl for same son, shift for id swap
- You can drag and drop tabs to reorder them

## Deploy

- If you want to locally deploy, download the WEB UI zip, and put all the other downloads (including itself) inside the `out/` folder
- Then serve it using http server (as feature like docs wouldn't work from direct file access)
